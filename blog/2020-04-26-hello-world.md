Welcome to this blog.

<!--truncate-->

This is not a test post.

I recently made this transition to my website from being a static site to something more. I wanted a place where I could log my thoughts, talk about books that I'm reading (been reading a lot lately) and code I want to share openly.

There are a lot of changes I really love about this setup. Firstly, I got to hack an off-the-shelf [tool](https://docusaurus.io/) to build it (doing that for the second time). Secondly, I am really thrilled to get my own [books page](/books). Goodreads as a social media is cool, but then there aren't a lot of people using it. This blog will also give me a way to share my on views on some of the books I really enjoyed reading them.

Lastly docusaurus is great for sharing programming experiences too. ðŸ™‚

```js
console.log("LOVE THEM CODEBLOCKS!");
```

How can you help ?

- I am a really clumsy at typing. So please let me know if there are tpyos. (Better off, send PR's!)
- I intend to add more posts/tutorials on a periodical basis. (Atleast once in a month, no promises but will definitely give it a try) SEND SUGGESTIONS.

I do not have a Long Term plan as of now. Personally, I am dealing with a lot of changes, and I cannot commit to a lot at the moment. But here are some of the things I want to fix sooner than later.

- ~[ ] Fix landing page, get a roadmap for the same~
- ~[ ] Figure out a way to add comments to posts~
- ~[ ] Plan next 3 posts (2 technical, 1 book review maybe?)~
- ~[ ] Add github action to deploy on push to master~

Ciao ðŸ‘‹
