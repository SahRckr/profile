It took quite an effort to get this up and running. I was on Docusaurus `v2.0`, decided to upgrade to `v3.0`. Broke the commenting feature in the process. I haven\'t touched a docusaurus based project for a very long time. I just realised retrospectively, that I created this space for me when I was between jobs back in mid 2020, and I am doing the same in late 2023!\\n\\nSo what happened between Aug 2020 and now? Well, a lot. I cannot share the entirety of it, but here\'s the gist. \\n\\n1. Got my final degree certificate. (Was supposed to graduate in 2016, graduated in Jan 2020, got the certificate later that year)\\n2. Read about 100+ books. (Check out the [recommended section](/books#recommended) for my top picks)\\n3. Worked at a series B startup (in the location tracking like space, again), learnt a lot under a very supportive manager. Got promoted (first time in my career).\\n4. Got hooked on to the [`Second Brain`](https://maggieappleton.com/basb) culture, and OKRs.\\n5. Worked at a late stage company\'s platform team (superapp based out of Indonesia), survived 2 different rounds of layoffs and calls for RTO.\\n\\n...And a lot more things.\\n\\n:::note P.S.\\n\\nI am on the look out for my next role. I am looking for something long term at a place with good IC path. I\'d prefer to work in the enterprise software space, but any role in a challenging domain would also be a good fit. [Reach out](/contact) to me over mail to take this further.\\n:::\\n\\nWhat to look for from this space?\\n\\nAs mentioned in my very first blog post, I cannot make any promises, but let me try to do this once in a month. I have a bunch of ideas on where I want to take this. I read a enough technical & non-fictional books to publish my own notes on them, tech interview culture, personal productivity, obsidian-based PKM and a lots more.\\n\\nUntil next time."},{"id":"/2020/08/21/react-opentable","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/08/21/react-opentable","source":"@site/blog/2020-08-21-react-opentable.md","title":"npm \ud83d\udce6 React OpenTable","description":"React wrapper for Opentable Reservation Widget","date":"2020-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 21, 2020","tags":[{"label":"opentable","permalink":"/blog/tags/opentable"},{"label":"react-opentable","permalink":"/blog/tags/react-opentable"},{"label":"react-opentable wrapper","permalink":"/blog/tags/react-opentable-wrapper"}],"readingTime":1.69,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Sahil Satishkumar","url":"https://sahilsatishkumar.dev/contact","imageURL":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8242514"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"npm \ud83d\udce6 React OpenTable","description":"React wrapper for Opentable Reservation Widget","author":"Sahil Satishkumar","author_url":"https://sahilsatishkumar.dev/contact","author_image_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8242514","tags":["opentable","react-opentable","react-opentable wrapper"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Welcome 2024!","permalink":"/blog/2024/01/01/welcome-2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"Soft Skills","permalink":"/blog/2020/08/16/Soft-skills"}},"content":"I published my very first npm package: [`react-opentable (v2.0.0)`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-opentable)\\n\\n![](https://badgen.net/npm/v/react-opentable) ![](https://badgen.net/npm/dt/react-opentable) ![](https://badgen.net/bundlephobia/minzip/react-opentable) ![](https://badgen.net/npm/license/react-opentable)\\n\\nThis post intends to be a helper document for the same, and will be kept upto date, if the package ever changes.

It covers a lot of topics normally not normally talked about in the software industry.\\n\\nShould you read it ? The answer depends on the kind of books you\'ve read in the past. If you have read a lot of non-fiction & self-help in the past, you should probably skip it.\\n\\nOn the other hand if you are a software developer & new to reading books in general. This might just be the perfect one for you.\\n\\n## The long version\\n\\nThe book is cleverly structured into 7 parts. There are 71 chapters, this will take a while for you to parse through. Each chapter is bite sized 1500-ish words, and are mostly unrelated. You should be able to pick it up, even if you decide to drop it off in between.\\n\\n1. Career\\n2. Marketing yourself\\n3. Learning\\n4. Productivity\\n5. Financial\\n6. Fitness\\n7. Spirit\\n\\nWhile the book starts with a very relatable content, but doesn\'t do a great job at keeping it relatable.\\n\\nA lot of the content which isn\'t about self development, will not apply to most of us. What works for a certain person, in a certain country might not work in every geography. I personally didn\'t like most of section 5 & section 6.\\n\\nIt would have added a lot of value if this book was written by a diverse bunch of authors, instead of, just John broadcasting his (legit) experiences & opinion.\\n\\nLet\'s pick a topic for example. John has made most of his income from real-estate. Let\'s assume that an average home costs like 2x - 3x the annual income of a software engineer with some years of experience, in a non major city. However, in a country like India cost of real-estate would be atleast 5x the annual income, if not more, than what a software engineer makes. And don\'t get me started on availability of homeloans (Interest rates have lower now, but the principal amount is not going down any time soon).\\n\\nOn the bright side of things, if this is your first book. You\'ll get some sort of a summary from a lot of other books.\\n\\n- [So Good They Can\'t Ignore You](https://amzn.to/3aBWbLu)\\n- [The Power of Habit](https://amzn.to/3g2Jc6y)\\n- [The Dip: The extraordinary benefits of knowing when to quit](https://amzn.to/3g0dBCr)  \\n  _(John does a better job of summarising this in 1 chapter, dragging the topic into a book.)_\\n\\n(I\'ve read only the aforementioned books, John does mention a bunch of books that I\'ve added to my reading queue)\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n\\nYou shouldn\'t take what anyone says as gospel...\\n\\n_(Chapter #71, Soft Skills)_\\n\\n</blockquote>\\n\\nP.S.: I may be \\"Marketing Myself\\" by reviving my blog."},{"id":"/2020/04/26/hello-world","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/04/26/hello-world","source":"@site/blog/2020-04-26-hello-world.md","title":"Hello World","description":"Welcome to this blog.","date":"2020-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 26, 2020","tags":[{"label":"books","permalink":"/blog/tags/books"},{"label":"random","permalink":"/blog/tags/random"}],"readingTime":1.49,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Sahil Satishkumar","url":"https://sahilsatishkumar.dev/contact","imageURL":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8242514"}],"frontMatter":{"id":"hello-world","title":"Hello World","author":"Sahil Satishkumar","author_url":"https://sahilsatishkumar.dev/contact","author_image_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8242514","tags":["books","random"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Soft Skills","permalink":"/blog/2020/08/16/Soft-skills"}},"content":"Welcome to this blog.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThis is not a test post.\\n\\nI recently made this transition to my website from being a static site to something more.

Personally, I am dealing with a lot of changes, and I cannot commit to a lot at the moment. But here are some of the things I want to fix sooner than later.\\n\\n- ~[ ] Fix landing page, get a roadmap for the same~\\n- ~[ ] Figure out a way to add comments to posts~\\n- ~[ ] Plan next 3 posts (2 technical, 1 book review maybe?)~\\n- ~[ ] Add github action to deploy on push to master~\\n\\nCiao \ud83d\udc4b"}]}')}}]);
